<h1> For So Long in U.S. History, The LGBTQ Community Has Been Seen as a Scourge to Society.</h1>
	
<h2> When it comes to basic respect and human decency, we haven't decided to extend it to one of the most subjugated minorities.</h2>
<p> As to why? There are many reasons. One, usually shady authority figures like our politicians or, our priests and pastors, distract desent and scrutiny to paint us as the enemy, degenerates that are out for blood or something.  Just so they can go on to do whatever suspicious thing they were gonna do, often being found a hypocrite themselves perfoming actions of which they fearmonger about us of doing.</p>

	<br>
 <p> 4.5 percent of Americans identify as a member of the LGBTQ community<sup>1</sup> Although that may seem like a small percentage, discrimination affects 14.6 million people everyday. </p> 
	<br>
	<p>LGBT discrimination laws pop up seemingly everyday, under the guise that "they're meant to protect your religious and first amendment rights<sup>2</sup>". On first glance, that may seem innocent and may even give you the impression that the first amendment is under a full-scale attack and religion is being destroyed, but that's far from the truth as you're still able to say almost whatever you want. The only real consequence just being that threats against one's life will be taken as literal or serious, which actually does happen to us more often than you think. We'll talk more about that later.
 </p>
 <br>
	<p> You know, It's a draining and depressing life when You have to stay on guard and looking over your shoulder, showing little trust towards people because you could never truly know their true intentions towards you. One second you can be enjoying your life and the next, you're the next victim of a hate-crime.<sup>3</sup> And you wanna know the sad part? No one ever believes you, "You're being overly-paranoid." "Calm down, no one is after you." But you know. You know that there's always a target on your back. You try to trust your fellow human but you can never be certain. And that's really depressing. We, as the whole LGBTQ community need to be recognized. We need to stop being seen as the enemy. We need to stop being subjugated for something that we cannot help about ourselves. And if want to help us, If you want to become an ally. Start with me. Start with the person that isn't just merely an identity. Start with the human that is begging for your help. Start with the woman that wants, no, <strong> NEEDS </strong> to be recognized. Thank you. </p>
